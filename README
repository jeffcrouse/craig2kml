INTRODUCTION
----------------
This project started as Earthify (http://www.earthify.org), which kept breaking.
I also heard recently that some websites that were scraping Craigslist were being blocked.  So I decided to take the idea and turn it into a simple c++ program that anyone could use on their own computer, or install on a server and make a Google Maps wrapper (which I plan to do at some point at earthify.org).


REQUIREMENTS
----------------
TidyLib		http://tidy.sourceforge.net/
libXML
libKML  	http://code.google.com/p/libkml/
libCurl


EXAMPLE USAGE
---------------
craig2kml --url "http://newyork.craigslist.org/search/nfa?query=&srchType=A&minAsk=&maxAsk=2000&bedrooms=&addTwo=purrr&hasPic=1" -o brooklynrental.kml

This will create the KML file "brooklynrental.kml" and populate it with placemarks for all of the listings that:

1) Have a link to a Google Map on the page, as many Craigslist listings do
2) Are geolocatable using the google Geolocation service: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/

TO DO
--------------
- Separate out the xpath expressions into a settings file so they are easily changeable
- Better error checking
- Add images and other information to listing descriptions
- Provide sample PHP usage code
- Use other contextual information to map non-mappable listings, such as title of the page and other geographic data
- Create option to follow pagination
