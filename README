INTRODUCTION
----------------
This project started as Earthify (http://www.earthify.org), which kept breaking.  I also heard recently that some websites that were scraping Craigslist were being blocked.  So I decided to take the idea and turn it into a simple c++ program that anyone could use on their own computer, or install on a server and make a Google Maps wrapper (which I plan to do at some point at earthify.org).


FAQ
-------------
1.  Why not just use the rss feeds?
The RSS feeds only include the most recent 25 entries.  By scraping the page, you can get all 100.  In future versions, it will follow the pagination also.

2. Is there a limit to how often I can use craig2kml?
Each listing that is parsed makes a call to the Google Geocoder API.  According to the "Usage Limits" section of the documentation (http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/#Limits), you can only perform 2,500 queries per day.  Presumably this is based on IP address.

3. The makefile isn't working.  What's up?
I use premake to generate makefiles.  You can find more information about it here http://industriousone.com/premake  This is not a requirement for building, but if you are having trouble building, you might want to take a look at the premake documentation.


REQUIREMENTS
----------------
TidyLib		http://tidy.sourceforge.net/
libXML2		http://xmlsoft.org/
libKML  	http://code.google.com/p/libkml/
libCurl		http://curl.haxx.se/


EXAMPLE USAGE
---------------
craig2kml -v --url "http://newyork.craigslist.org/search/nfa?query=&srchType=A&minAsk=&maxAsk=2000&bedrooms=&addTwo=purrr&hasPic=1" -o brooklynrental.kml

This will create the KML file "brooklynrental.kml" and populate it with placemarks.  There are 2 folders: Mappable Listings and Unmappable Listings. The unmappable ones (those without a google maps link or fail geocoding) are placed in the middle of the mappable ones.


TO DO
--------------
- Don't overwrite output file until the end, but check to make sure that it we can create the file at the beginning.
- Better error checking
- use regular expression instead of xpath for google maps link?
- Provide sample JavaScript usage code
- Use other contextual information to map non-mappable listings, such as title of the page and other geographic data
- Create option to follow pagination
- There are probably tons of memory leaks.  I haven't done much releasing at all.
- Fix prebuild script so that the generated Makefile works.
- When you compile with the makefile, there are no results??  faulty linking?
